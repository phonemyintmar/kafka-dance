This module intended to test some more kafka concepts, but havne't test much first.
Now we are putting retry and dlt configs in here and test.

In kafka, there is non blocking retries and blocking retries, use what fits ur proj, but seems like non blocking is better
so we are using non blocking in here.

most of the stuff done here are from this document (https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/retrytopic/retry-config.html).

Alot of things in here are not really tested yet. But pretty sure most of things will work, we just took the most simplest things
that we think we needs. Just setup the kafka and make a topic and try it maybe. pretty sure it will just work or will only need a slight twist.
Of coz here we have multiple configs we might need to fix them and get a config and try. but this should be enough.


Just setup some visual for kafka and test different approachs mentioned in this repo if we needs it. Your welcome :).
